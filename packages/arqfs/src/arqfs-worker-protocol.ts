/**
 * The request/response message shapes between a main-thread caller and the
 * Arq-owned dedicated Worker that actually runs SQLite (ADR-0024) - shared here so a
 * future main-thread client and workers/arqfs-worker's implementation stay in sync
 * without either importing the other's runtime code. postMessage RPC is
 * request/response with an `id` for correlation, not a raw exec/query passthrough -
 * batches whole operations across the JS/WASM Worker boundary rather than one
 * message per SQL statement (docs/architecture/SHARED-RUST-CORE.md's WASM guidance:
 * "avoid frequent small calls across the JS and WASM boundary; batch queries and
 * operations").
